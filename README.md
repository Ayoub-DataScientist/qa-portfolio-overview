# QA/SDET Portfolio: Ayoub

##  Overview

Welcome to my Quality Assurance (QA) and Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) portfolio. This collection of repositories is designed to showcase my practical skills in modern software testing, automation, and quality engineering, targeting junior to mid-level roles.

The portfolio demonstrates my ability to move beyond simple test execution to **design comprehensive test strategies**, implement robust **test automation frameworks**, and integrate quality practices into the **CI/CD pipeline**.
